            <h1>Welcome to westValue!<br>
            The EPA Selector</h1>
        <details><summary>How does westValue work?</summary>
            <p>Simple! 3 steps and a short survey:
                <ul><li>Step 1 - Right Resident. 
                    <ul><li>The resident may have given you a link straight to their custom "portal".</li>
                    <li>If not, you can select any resident at <a href="$ResDirectory">the Resident Directory</a>.</li></ul></li>
                <li>Step 2 - Right Rotation
                    <ul><li>From that resident's custom "portal", just <i>select your rotation</i>.</li>
                        <li>westValue tries to make it easy by looking up the resident's schedule in Amion, but you can choose any from the list.</li></ul></li>
                <li>Step 3 - Pick an EPA
                    <ul><li>Given the rotation, westValue recommends a few EPAs common on that rotation.</li>
                        <li>However, you can <i>choose any EPA</i> you think appropriate. (Among the EPAs for which we have surveys ready - more will be available over time.)</li>
                    </ul></li>
                <li>A Short Survey
                    <ul><li>Click the EPA &amp; you're <i>whisked to a customized Qualtrics survey</i>. Seriously, it's short - an intro page + one short page of questions.</li></ul></li>
            </ul></p>
            <p>And that's it! Computers are magic!</p></details>
            
            
		<details><summary>What is the deal with EPAs?</summary>
            <p>The new, coolest things in medical training feedback are 
              <a href="https://www.abp.org/entrustable-professional-activities-epas">Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs)</a>.</p> 
              <p>17 EPAs cover broad domains of pediatrics. E.g., EPA #3 is "care of the well newborn".</p>
              <p>westValue takes EPAs as the organizing framework for feedback. Instead of long, vague evals about trainees in general or whole rotations, westValue uses <i>very short</i> Qualtrics surveys to collect feedback on specific EPAs.</p>
            <p>We hope these <i>short</i> surveys will provide a greater volume of more specific feedback. The idea is that trainees gradually learn to be entrusted to perform these EPAs independently, and westValue tracks their learning.</p>
