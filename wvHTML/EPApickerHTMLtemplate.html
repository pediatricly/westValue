		<details><summary>What is an EPA?</summary><p>The new, coolest things in medical training feedback are 
              <a href="https://www.abp.org/entrustable-professional-activities-epas">Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs)</a>.</p> 
              <p>17 EPAs cover broad domains of pediatrics. E.g., EPA #3 is "care of the well newborn".</p>
              <p>The idea is that trainees gradually learn to be entrusted with all these activities independently.</p> 
              <p>westValue uses <i>very short</i> Qualtrics surveys to track trainee progress across the EPAs.</p></details>

              <p>Finally, let's pick an entrustable professional activity (EPA) for feedback.<br>
                  You may notice not all 17 EPAs are listed below. We are deploying them gradually as we test these surveys. Thank you for your feedback &amp; patience!<br>
                  All links below will take you to a <b>brief</b> Qualtrics form customized for <strong>$FName $LName</strong>.
