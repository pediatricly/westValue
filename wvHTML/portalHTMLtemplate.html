<details><summary>The feedback process is customized by rotation.</summary>
<p>We do this because:
    <ol><li>It is useful to know in what setting feedback was received.</li>
        <li>We want residents to get feedback spread across all the EPAs while making it very easy for you to pick a            relevant one. (e.g., EPA 3 for Well Baby, not Adol.)</li>
    </ol>
