            <h1>Welcome to westValue!</h1>

		<details><summary>What is an EPA?</summary><p>The new, coolest things in medical training feedback are 
              <a href="https://www.abp.org/entrustable-professional-activities-epas">Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs)</a>.</p> 
              <p>17 EPAs cover broad domains of pediatrics. E.g., EPA #3 is "care of the well newborn".</p>
              <p>The idea is that trainees gradually learn to be entrusted with all these activities independently.</p> 
              <p>westValue uses <i>very short</i> Qualtrics surveys to track trainee progress across the EPAs.</p></details>

            <div id="rightResident"><h2>(Step 1/3) Right Resident?</h2>
<p>Links on this page have been customized for <strong>$FName $LName</strong>. 
<ul><li>If that is whom you want to evaluate, great! Please proceed.</li>
    <li>If you are looking for <i>another trainee</i>, please go to the <a href="$ResDirectory">Resident Directory</a></li></ul></p></div>

<div id="pickRotation"><h2>(Step 2/3) Pick the Rotation</h2>
<p>We have customized Qualtrics links by rotation for 2 reasons.<br>
<ol><li>We want residents to know in what setting feedback was received.</li>
<li>We want residents to get feedback spread across all the EPAs while making it very easy for you to pick a relevant one. (e..g, EPA 3 for Well Baby but not Adol.)</li></ol></p></div>
