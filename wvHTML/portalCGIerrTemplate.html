		<details><summary>What is an EPA?</summary><p>The new, coolest things in medical training feedback are <a href="https://www.abp.org/entrustable-professional-activities-epas">Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs)</a>. 17 EPAs cover broad domains of pediatrics. E.g., EPA #3 is "care of the well newborn". The idea is that trainees gradually learn to be entrusted with all these activities independently. westValue uses <i>very short</i> Qualtrics surveys to track trainee progress.</p></details>
